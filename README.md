# File_Database_CPP
A simple database management using a file structure written in C++

This code's features are :

1 - Inserting a record

2 - Listing the records

3 - Searching a record

4 - Updating a record

There are a few bugs in the code such as when you're updating a record, the last added record will be duplicated in the .dat file when you update a record.

Other than that, just a simple program I made myself. Feel free to fix any bugs if you want to or let me know how to fix it.
